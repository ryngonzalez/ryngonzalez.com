This tea is light and clear, an almost golden tint like honey thinned to its slightest. Splenda isn’t great for me, but its better than real sugar—less calories—but for some reason I feel like the real stuff should be better. Anyway, I like the taste of Splenda—overly sweet for the amount. Just don’t take a straight lick of it.

Maybe I’ve taken too many licks of it all. I’ve been feeling unhealthy lately. My throat. No, my stomach and all the tracts and pathways that lead to it seem congested, like there’s something trapped in their walls stuck between tissue and clogging me up. I feel like burping. I’ve been trying to burp for the last two days, and I get one out on occassion. But the feeling just keeps coming back up.

I’ve been eating a lot, consistently. And it’s not even because of an excess of great taste. It’s simply neglect. Not being there as I’m chowing down on a porkchop or a couple pieces of breaded, slightly spicy pieces of chicken. Not even good chicken. The way I feel—how my day is going, how the little details of they day are progressing, make me more likely to splurge. If I’m having a bad day: “I need some food to cheer me up.” Good day: “Let’s celebrate. Live, eat.”

Peaks. Valleys. They make me hungry, and it’s killing me.

The milk is the worst thing about this cup of tea. There’s some fat on it. Screw skim milk. All the calories, all those little arbitrary bits of info on energy that don’t mean anything when I’m tired or happy and ready to sip on a nice cup of brew, are from that nice white froth. It’s made the tea light and opaque. It’s smooth. I tip the cup to my lips and see a few brown particles from the tea bag, drifting along on the edges of the drink.

My mind is a bit fuzzy thinking about it all. How am I supposed to feel about food? I want it to be a comfort. That’s how I’ve lived. But diets and evolution and the damn laws of thermodynamics sit facing me and poke at my idea. Food is sustinence. It’s the ability to live.

They say that if you make it about comfort, however, then it can become inability to keep living.

The truth is somewhere in between. Food isn’t the problem… How I measure, how I view, how I let food into my life. That’s it.

Awareness is important. Being present—eating slowly, letting the food bring you pleasure, slowly permeating the buds of your tongue—that can change how you view it. Being cognizant of the details, like I do when I code, design, or write, can make the experience more full and real. You can feel it.

Fredericco Viticci has cancer.

I’ve been thinking a lot about it lately. How do you make the cognitive dissonance of a 23 being diagnosed with cancer go away? I haven’t been able to.

I turn 19 in a week. I feel like I’ve neglected my health for too long. I’ve always been a pretty heavy-set guy, but athletics have been part of my life for so long. Fall, spring. Football for a few years, Fútbol for a few more. These things have been stop gaps for me from being active in how I treat my health. They’ve given me the ability to say: “The hell with not eating this slice of cake. Coach will run it out of me anyway.”

But there are no more coaches. I am left alone as the only one on the sideline.

I don’t want to be 23 and diagnosed with something I could’ve prevented, as much as Viticci didn’t want to be diagnosed with something he couldn’t. I can change what I do and get better. I don’t have to be scared about what I can control if I care only a bit more.

If it’s possible, why wouldn’t I? Run. Lift. Make eating about the experience, not your gut being full.

Try harder.
