    <h1>Hi. I'm Kathryn Gonzalez üè≥Ô∏è‚Äçüåà</h1>

    <p>I'm an <strong>engineer and designer</strong> who enjoys wading in the space between those two disciplines, currently focused on Design Systems.</p>

    <p>I lead the <a href="https://medium.com/@ryngonzalez/design-systems-and-infrastructure-where-design-and-engineering-meet-3e7d2908558a">Design Infrastructure</a> team at DoorDash, where I was hired as our first Product Designer and Frontend Engineer. I build for Web, iOS, and Android.</p>

    <p>Previously, I was the Lead Designer and Software Engineer at Fetchnotes. Before that, I spent a summer designing and developing at <a href="/work/fuzzco" class="fuzzco-link">Fuzzco</a> in b-e-a-utiful Charleston, in my home state of South Carolina.</p>

    <p>I studied Computer Science Engineering at the University of Michigan. Go Blue!</p>
