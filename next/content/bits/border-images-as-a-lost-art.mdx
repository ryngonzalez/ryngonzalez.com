In the days of photoshop as a design tool, pre-baking text in images to enable custom fonts, and a lack of core CSS styling properties like `box-shadow` or `border-radius`, there were _so_ many hacky workarounds that we had to employ!

But of all the things that CSS _did provide,_ `border-image` was the one that always felt like magic. Nine-slice assets, being able to create faux shadows or visually complicated borders was a fun and unexpected capability when the newness of building websites was the limiting factor in our ability to be visually expressive.

But for many reasons, this tool has taken a back seat in our current cultural climate as web developers and designers.
