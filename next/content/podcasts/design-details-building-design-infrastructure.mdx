_This week, we have an interview! We caught up with **[Kathryn Gonzalez](https://twitter.com/ryngonzalez)**, the Head of Design Infrastructure at DoorDash. We talk about her experience building DoorDash’s design system from scratch, working as a technical designer, hiring for design systems roles, and much more._

### **_Cool Things:_**

- _Kathryn shared **[March Madness](https://www.ncaa.com/news/basketball-men/article/2021-march-madness-schedule)**, which is actually happening this year!_
- _Brian shared **[The Falcon and The Winter Soldier](https://disneyplusoriginals.disney.com/show/the-falcon-and-the-winter-soldier)**, the newest Disney+ series for the MCU. We’re only one episode in, but it’s off to a good start._
- _Marshall shared **[Formula 1: Drive to Survive on Netflix](https://www.netflix.com/title/80204890)**. Even if you’re not into cars or racing, it’s a show that ramps you up and gets you invested in the players and teams._
