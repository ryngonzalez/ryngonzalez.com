Out of the many things that I dabbled in before (I remember thinking of myself as an unfortunate dilettante), I used to circle most around writing. I was obsessed with blogs, delivered to me through Google Reader subscriptions painstakingly curated over the years in middle and high school. I wrote short film scripts, poorly paced and overly specific novellas, and a link-blog styled after Daring Fireball that I spent a summer between 8th and 9th grade working on.

Most of all, I loved hearing the voices of writers come through in the things that they focused on and how they put their words out into the worldâ€”it gave me a sense ofÂ *them*, in a way that I felt I could strive for myself. A hope that I could put my own voice out there, making something through words.

For the last nine years, Iâ€™ve been owned by my career. Iâ€™ve spent most of my 20â€™s building companies as an early employee (both of which were incredibly tiny, with one ending quietly and one becoming a defining company) and finding my worth and value in the corporate spaces that I helped shape. My energy, actions, and time I spent were focused on this side of meâ€”employee, designer, engineerâ€”and the rest of my life felt more shallow for much of that time.

Yes, along the way, there were significant moments for me outside of workâ€”coming out as trans four years ago, losing and finding long-term love, and developing friendships and care with my family that I didnâ€™t have the capacity for in the past. But behind it all, work and the meaning I sought in it often overwhelmed me and held a top seat in the priorities I had in my headâ€”for better or worse.

So, for a long time, I felt like I had to sacrifice myself to succeed. To meet the expectations of the people around meâ€”my peers, leaders, reportsâ€”I had to be all in. And even though this is decidedlyÂ *not true*Â (if my boss sees this, know that theyâ€™ve done everything they can in dissuading me from this view)*,*Â the way that I think and operate leads me to this view on work. While Iâ€™ve taken steps to pull back from this mindset through therapy, self-care, and other means, Iâ€™ve been mostly unsuccessful. And with that lack of success, Iâ€™ve continued pouring so much of myself into work, like gasoline on a flame. Out in the wilderness, alone, getting smoked out by the fire I set for myself. Burnt out in a way that,Â *this time*, I have to take seriously.

Right now, itâ€™s the last night before the end of my (admittedly short) vacation. I went to Honolulu to try to see friends and nature, and amid both happy and depressive moments, I spent a long time thinking about my life as it stands now. One of the things I figured out this past week away is that I found a lack ofÂ *myself*Â and the interests I care about in my life nowâ€”that I missed is finding something IÂ *loved*, that I could lean on andÂ *do*Â actively, that I could step towards as I tried to find the proper distance away from work and the way that it leads me to feel.

And as I sat in my hotel, I thought about how I used to love crafting wordsâ€”trying to put something interesting, thoughtful, careful, exploratory onto a page. I missed how good that felt. How important it was for me to have aÂ *voice*Â for myself beyond the one that I made in my work with startups and design. So Iâ€™m going to try again, to be back making things in service to honing and sharing thatÂ *voice*â€”stepping out of the smoky wilderness to live for the things that I care about, way-finding to a better kind of living, and writing about it all along the way.
