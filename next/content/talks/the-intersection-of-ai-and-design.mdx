_Candid fireside chat facilitated by Martin Woodward with panelists Kathryn Gonzalez, Amelia Wattenberger, and Sally Woellner. During this chat we explore the impact of AI on software development and design. Our panel of experts share their insights, experiences, and predictions on this rapidly-evolving and complex topic. We discuss the opportunities and challenges AI presents, how AI will influence how we design, and where the future may be headed._

I had an opportunity to speak at GitHub’s internally presented conference, LGTM, for their design team to speak with Amelia, Sally, and Martin about AI, design, and software development! It was an honor to have this conversation with others working in the space, and to illuminate the opportunities AI brings to creativity.

> _Design systems and AI powered design tools are more about helping raise the floor versus limiting the ceiling of what a designer can do. Being able to give more time to the things that do actually give you space to think differently and have more creativity in your work… that’s where we’re going to see more creativity arise._ > **- Kathryn Gonzalez**
