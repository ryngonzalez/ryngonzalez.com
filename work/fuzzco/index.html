<h2>What I did</h2>

<p>Worked as a Ruby, JavaScript, CSS/HTML, and WordPress developer on various client project and on internal applications like <a href="http://goestowork.com">Goes To Work</a>. Worked on various web designs for smaller clients. Learned about the world of client services, working with deadlines and time-tracking, and collaborating on a team for the first time.</p>

<h2>Story</h2>

<p>Growing up in rural South Carolina, you don't have very many choices in design heroes. There were people like <a href="https://twitter.com/whale">@whale</a> aka <a href="http://matthewsmith.cc/">Matthew Smith</a>, and his collective of designers and developers in Greenville, and for the longest time, that's all I knew.</p>

<p>Sometime in the Fall of 2011, I discovered Fuzzco. I remember a pretty distinct moment: after finding them, I had been spending a few weeks trawling their <a href="https://dribbble.com/fuzzco">Dribbble</a> page, and dishing out Ooos and Aaaahs on the regular. Somewhere in that span, I ended up checking out their website, and finding out they were based in South Carolina with equal parts excitement and bafflement.</p>

<blockquote>They're from South Carolina?!</blockquote>

<p>So I made a mental note and tucked it away as a nugget of possibility. Fast-forward a couple of months to January, and I was starting to think of a what I could spend my first summer between college semesters working on. The list was short, admittedly, and I knew what my main option wasâ€¦ so I decided to go all out for it. I built a dedicated site on my server (RIP <em>ionizemedia.com</em>) and produced it as a letter to Fuzzco. One email, a night of sleep, and an excited dash to check my inbox later, and I had the wheels turning to get myself a summer working with some of the nicest, most talented people working in design today.</p>
